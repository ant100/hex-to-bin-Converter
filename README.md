# hexBinConverter
A simple hex/bin converter built in Ruby. I was just trying to learn some Ruby and thought this would be a fun project. The code is far from pretty, but I made my best attempt. Hopefully, I will be able to look at this in a year and laught at it :) (meaning in a year I will know much more than I know now).

# To do list:
- Validate that user enters the number in the correct system (can be done with regex)
