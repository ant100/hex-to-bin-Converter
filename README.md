# Hex to Bin Converter
A simple hex/bin converter built in Ruby. I was just trying to learn some Ruby and thought this would be a fun project. It works on the command line, you just input a number in binary or hexadecimal and it will do the convertion.

# What I learned
* How to convert from binary to hexadecimal
* Confidence with the % operator

# To do list:
- Validate that user enters the number in the correct system (can be done with regex)
